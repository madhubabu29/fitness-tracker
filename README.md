# Fitness Tracker (Static)

A minimal client-side fitness tracker designed to run on GitHub Pages. Data is stored locally in your browser (localStorage). You can export/import JSON or CSV to move data between devices.

How to use

1. Open the site (GitHub Pages URL for this repo).
2. Use Quick Add to add a workout/exercise. Seed sample to try the Chestpress example.
3. Export JSON/CSV to back up your data.

Notes
- No server: all data is local. If you clear browser storage or change devices, export your data first.
- This is a simple scaffold. You can extend with IndexedDB, better UI, or frameworks.

Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Ensure repository has Pages enabled pointing at the main branch root.
- The files in this repo are static and will be served by GitHub Pages.
